"""Grids and blocks: the review page's view for tables (Andrew, 2026-10-16: "add a 'grids and blocks' view to the
reviewer and just route the skill through there ... a button to check and validate it in one click").

Every numbered table and repeated block the layout code finds (eval/grid_naming.grids) is listed with its cells, and
one click runs the lightest method that settles it, in order:

  1. the code check: already on pattern -> its cells accepted, nothing else;
  2. the resolver (grid_naming.resolve): each position's wording, settled by the name-check model against the
     position's shared caption, then the numbers (1..N, unless the series continues from another page or the
     numbers are printed line numbers) -> the renames applied as Claude's, the cells accepted;
  3. Jev: a position the model could not settle, chosen from its candidate wordings with the page image ->
     resolved again with that wording, applied and accepted;
  4. Opus (the chat with the grid-validation skill's rules, this page only): only what is still unclear; its
     proposals come back for the person to tick, nothing applied.

Nothing is stored about the tables in the blueprint (they may get names there later).
